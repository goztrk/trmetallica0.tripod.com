Open doors so I walk inside <br>
Close my eyes <br>
Find my place to hide <br>
And I shake as I take it in <br>

Open my eyes <br>
Just to have them close again <br>
Well on my way <br>

Just to have them close once again <br>
Don't want control <br>

Mama, she has taught me well <br>
Told me when I was young <br>
Son, your life's an open book <br>
Don't close it 'fore its done <br><br>

The brightest flame burns quickest <br>
Is what I heard her say <br>
A son's heart sewed to mother <br>
But I must find my way <br><br>

    Let my heart go <br>
    Let your son grow <br>
    Mama, let my heart go <br>
    Or let this heart be still <br><br>

Rebel my new last name <br>
Wild blood in my veins <br>
Apron strings around my neck <br>
The mark that still remains <br><br>

Left home at an early age <br>
Of what I heard was wrong <br>
I never asked forgiveness <br>
But what is said is done <br><br>

    Let my heart go <br>
    Let your son grow <br>
    Mama, let my heart go <br>
    Or let this heart be still <br><br>

        Never I ask of you <br>
        But never I gave <br>
        But you gave me your emptiness <br>
        I now take to my grave <br>
        Never I ask of you <br>
        But never I gave <br>
        But you gave me your emptiness <br>
        I now take to my grave <br>
        So let this heart be still <br><br>

Mama, now I'm coming home <br>
I'm not all you wished of me <br>
A mother's love for her son <br>
Spoken, help me be <br><br>

Well, I took your love for granted <br>
And all the things you said to me <br>
I need your arms to welcome me <br>
But,a cold stone's all I see <br><br>

    Let my heart go <br>
		Let your son grow<br>
    Mama, let my heart go <br>
    Or let this heart be still <br><br>

    Let my heart go <br>
    Mama, let my heart go <br>
    You never let my heart go <br>
    So let this heart be still <br><br>

        Never I ask of you <br>
        But never I gave <br>
        But you gave me your emptiness <br>
        I now take to my grave <br>
        Never I ask of you <br>
        But never I gave <br>
        But you gave me your emptiness <br>
        I now take to my grave <br>
        So let this heart be still <br>

Forgive me father <br>
For I have sinned <br>
Find me guilty of the life I feel within <br><br>

When I'm branded <br>
This mark of shame <br>
Should I look down disgraced <br>
Or straight ahead <br>
And know that you must blame <br><br>

    I am, I am the secret <br>
    I am, I am the sin <br>
    I am, I am the guilty <br>
    And I, I am the thorn within <br><br>

Forgive me father <br>
For I have sinned <br>
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within <br><br>

So point your fingers <br>
Point right at me <br>
For I am shadows <br>
And will follow you <br>
One and the same are we <br><br>

    I am, I am the secret <br>
    I am, I am the sin <br>
    I am, I am the guilty <br>
    And I, I am the thorn within <br><br>

I do your time <br>
I take your fall <br>
I'm branded guilty <br>
For us all <br><br>

So point your fingers <br>
Point right at me <br>
For I am shadows <br>
And will follow you <br>
One and the same are we <br><br>

    I am, I am your secrets <br>
    I am, I am your sin <br>
    I am, I am your guilty <br>
    And I, I am the thorn within <br>
    I am the thorn within <br>

Stories start <br>
Quiet town <br>
Small town boy <br>
Big time frown <br>
Never talks <br>
Never plays <br>
Different path <br>
Lost his way 
<br><br>
The streets are red <br>
Red I'm afraid <br>
There's no confetti <br>
No parade <br>
Nothing happens in this boring place <br>
But oh my god how it all did change <br><br>

Now they all pray <br>
Blood stain wash away <br><br>

    He said <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br><br>

    I heard him <br>
    He said <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    All things wash away <br>
    But blood stained the sun red today <br>
<br>
I always said <br>
Something wrong <br>
With little strange <br>
Ronnie Long <br>
Never laughed <br>
Never smiled <br>
Talked alone for miles <br>
And miles and miles <br><br>

Gallow calls <br>
Son I say <br>
Keep your smile <br>
And laugh all day <br>
Think once again in this boring place <br>
For little boys how they soon change <br><br>

Now they all pray <br>
Blood stain wash away <br><br>

    He said <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br><br>

    Yeah, I heard him <br>
    He said <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    All things wash away <br>
    But blood stained the sun red today <br><br>

    (Spoken) <br>
            Yeah, well all the green things died <br>
            When Ronnie moved to this place <br>
            He said, "don't you dare ask, <br>
            why I'm cursed to wear this face" <br><br>

            Now we all know why <br>
            The children called him Ronnie Frown <br>
            When he pulled that gun from his pocket <br>
            They all fall down, down, down <br><br>

    He said <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br>
<br>
    Yeah, Yeah,I heard him <br>
    He screamed <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    This bloody day <br>
    Lost my way <br>
    All things wash away <br>
    But blood stained the sun red today <br><br>

That's right <br>
All things wash away <br>
And they all fall down <br>
But blood stained the sun today <br><br>

All things wash away <br>
An yhey all fall down <br>
But blood stained the sun today<br>

And now I wait my whole lifetime <br>
For you <br>
And now I wait my whole lifetime <br>
For you <br><br>

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide <br>
For you <br>
I search the outside, search inside <br>
For you <br><br>

To take back what you left me <br>
I know I'll always burn to be <br>
The one seeks so I may find <br>
And now I wait my whole lifetime <br><br>

    Outlaw of torn <br>
    And I'm torn <br><br>

So on I wait my whole lifetime <br>

For you <br><br>

The more I search the more my need <br>
For you <br>
The more I bless the more I bleed <br>
For you <br><br>

You make me smash the clock and feel <br>
I'd rather die behind the wheel <br>
Time was never on my side <br>
So on I wait my whole lifetime <br><br>

        And when I start to come undone <br>
        Stich me together <br>
        Save me <br>
        And when you see me strut <br>
        Remind me of what left this outlaw torn <br><br>
