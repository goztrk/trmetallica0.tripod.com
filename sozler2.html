<font color="red">..::!Fight Fire with Fire</font><br><br>
Do unto others as they have done unto you <br>
But what in the hell is this world coming to? <br><br>

Blow the universe into nothingness <br>
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    Fight fire with fire <br>
    Ending is near <br>
    Fight fire with fire <br>
    Bursting with fear <br><br>

    We all shall die <br><br>

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast <br>
Armageddon is here, like said in the past <br><br>

chorus: <br><br>

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death <br>
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath <br><br>

chorus: <br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Ride the Lightning</font><br><br>
Guilty as charged <br>
But damn it, it ain't right <br>
There is someone else controlling me <br><br>

Death in the air <br>
Strapped in the electric chair <br>
This can't be happening to me <br><br>

Who made you God to say <br>
"I'll take your life from you!" <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    Flash before my eyes <br>
    Now it's time to die <br>
    Burning in my brain <br>
    I can feel the flames <br><br>

Wait for the sign <br>
To flick the switch of death <br>
It's the beginning of the end <br><br>

Sweat, chilling cold <br>
As I watch death unfold <br>
Consciousness my only friend <br><br>

My fingers grip with fear <br>
What I am doing here? <br><br>

chorus: <br><br>

Someone help me <br>
Oh please God help me <br>
They are trying to take it all away <br>
I don't want to die <br><br>

Time moving slowly <br>
The minutes seem like hours <br>
The final curtain call I see <br><br>

How true is this? <br>
Just get it over with <br>
If this is true, just let it be <br><br>

Wakened by the horrid scream <br>
Freed from the frightening dream <br><br>

(chorus)<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!For Whom the Bell Tolls</font><br><br>
Make his fight on the hill in the early day <br>
Constant chill deep inside <br>
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey <br>
On they fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say? <br>
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know <br>
Suffered wounds test there their pride <br>
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow <br>
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    For whom the bell tolls <br>
    Time marches on <br>
    For whom the bell tolls <br><br>

Take a look to the sky just before you die <br>
It is the last time you will <br>
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky <br>
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry <br>
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery <br>
He hears the silence so loud <br>
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be <br>
Now the will see what will be, blinded eyes to see <br><br>

chorus:<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Fade to Black</font><br><br>
Life it seems, will fade away <br>
Drifting further every day <br>
Getting lost within myself <br>
Nothing matters no one else <br>
I have lost the will to live <br>
Simply nothing more to give <br>
There is nothing more for me <br>
Need the end to set me free <br><br>

Things are not what they used to be <br>
Missing one inside of me <br>
Deathly lost, this can't be real <br>
Cannot stand this hell I feel <br>
Emptiness is filing me <br>
To the point of agony <br>
Growing darkness taking dawn <br>
I was me, but now He's gone <br><br>

No one but me can save myself, but it to late <br>
Now I can't think, think why I should even try <br><br>

Yesterday seems as though it never existed <br>
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye<br><br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Trapped Under Ice</font><br><br>
I don't know how to live trough this hell<br> 
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell <br>
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core <br>
Break the ice, I can't take anymore <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    Freezing <br>
    Can't move at all <br>
    Screaming <br>
    Can't hear my call<br> 
    I am dying to live <br>
    Cry out <br>
    I'm trapped under the ice <br><br>

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest <br>
Eyes of glass stare directly at death <br>
From deep sleep I have broken away <br>
No one knows, no one hears what I say <br><br>

chorus: <br><br>

Scream from my soul <br>
Fate, mystified <br>
Hell, forever more <br><br>

No release from my cryonic state <br>
What is this? I've been stricken by fate <br>
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free <br>
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me <br><br>

chorus:<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Escape</font><br><br>
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy <br>
I know I'm my best friend <br>
No one cares, but I'm so much strongerv <br>
I'll fight until the end <br>
To escape from the true false world <br>
Undamaged destiny <br>
Can't get caught in the endless circle <br>
Ring of stupidity <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    Out of my own, out to be free <br>
    One with my mind, they just can't see <br>
    No need to hear things that they say <br>
    Life is for my own to live my own way <br><br>

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings <br>
Don't tell my what to do <br>
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side <br>
And I can see through you <br>
Feed my brain with your so called standards <br>
Who says that I ain't right <br>
Break away from your common fashion <br>
See through your blurry sight <br><br>

chorus: <br><br>

See they try to bring the hammer down <br>
No damn chains can hold me to the ground <br>
Life is for my own to live my own way <br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Creeping Death</font><br><br>
Slaves <br>
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh <br>
Heed <br>
To his every word, live in fear <br>
Faith <br>
Of the unknown one, the deliverer <br>
Wait <br>
Something must be done, four hundred years <br><br>

chorus: <br>
    So let it be written <br>
    So let it be done <br>
    I'm sent here by the chosen one <br>
    So let it be written <br>
    So let it be done <br>
    To kill the first born pharaoh son <br>
    I'm creeping death <br><br>

Now <br>
Let my people go, land of goshen <br>
Go <br>
I will be with thee, bush of fire <br>
Blood <br>
Running red and strong, down the nile <br>
Plague <br>
Darkness three days long, hail to fire <br><br>

chorus: <br><br>

Die by my hand <br>
I creep across the land <br>
Killing first born man <br>
Die by my hand <br>
I creep across the land <br>
Killing first born man <br><br>

I <br>
Rule the midnight air the destroyer <br>
Born <br>
I shall soon be there, deadly mass <br>
I <br>
Creep the steps and flood final darkness <br>
Blood <br>
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass <br><br>

chorus: <br>
