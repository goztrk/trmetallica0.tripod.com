Or are you unforgiven too? <br><br>

Lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear <br>
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again <br>
She lay beside me, But she'll be there when I'm gone <br>
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone <br>

My fingers seek my veins <br>
Theres a dog at your back step <br>
He must come in from the rain <br><br>

I fall cause I let go <br>
The net below has rot away <br>
So my eyes seek reality <br>
And my fingers seek my veins <br><br>

The trash fire is warm <br>
But nowhere safe from the storm <br>
And I can't bare to see <br>
What I've let me be <br>
So wicked and worn <br><br>

So as I write to you <br>
Of what is done and to do <br>
Maybe you'll understand <br>
And won't cry for this man <br>
'Cause low man is due <br><br>

Please forgive me <br><br>

        My eyes seek reality <br>
        My fingers feel for faith <br>
        Touch clean with a dirty hand <br>
        I touched the clean to the waste <br><br>

        Confess all to the rain <br>
        But I lie, lie straight to the mirror <br>
        The one I've broken, to match my face <br><br>

And won't cry for this man <br>
'Cause low man is due <br><br>

Please forgive me <br>
Please forgive me <br><br>

    So low the sky is all I see <br>
    All I want from you is forgive me <br>
    So you bring this poor dog in from the rain <br>
    Though he just wants right back out again <br><br>

My eyes seek reality <br>
My fingers seek my veins <br>
(humming)<br>

Suppose I say <br>
I'm never satisfied <br>
Suppose I say <br>
You cut some root <br>
To make the tree survive <br><br>

Just let me kill you for a while <br>
Just let me kill you for a smile <br>
Just let me kill you once <br>
I'm oh so bored to death <br><br>

    Ohhhh, I hunger <br>
    I hunger <br>
    I eat <br><br>

        Born Into Attitude <br>
        Asleep at the wheel <br>
        Throw all your bullets in the fire <br>
        And run like hell <br>
        Why cure the fever? <br>
        What ever happened to sweat? <br><br>

Suppose I say <br>
the vultures smile at me <br>
Suppose I say <br>
I've sent them down <br>
And they plan to pick you clean <br><br>

And satifaction this way comes <br>
And satifaction this way comes <br>
And satifaction's here and gone, gone <br>
Yeah gone again <br><br>

    Oooh, I hunger <br>
    Ooh I hunger <br>
    I eat <br><br>

        Born Into Attitude <br>
        Asleep at the wheel <br>
        Throw all your bullets in the fire <br>
        And stand there <br><br>

        Born Into Attitude <br>
        Twist mother tongue <br>
        Throw all your bullets in the fire <br>
        And run like hell <br>
        Why cure the fever? <br>
        What ever happened to sweat? <br><br>

Solo <br><br>

Just let me kill you for a while <br>
Just let me kill you for a smile <br>
Just let me kill you once for me <br>
I'm bored to death <br><br>

And satifaction this way comes <br>
And satifaction this way comes <br>
And satifaction's here and gone, gone <br>
gone again <br><br>

    Yeah I hunger <br>
    Oooh I hunger <br>
    I eat <br><br>

        Born Into Attitude <br>
        Asleep at the wheel <br>
        Throw all your bullets in the fire <br>
        And stand there <br><br>

        Born Into Attitude <br>
        Twist mother tongue <br>
        Throwing all your bullets in the fire <br>
        And run like hell <br>
        Why cure the fever? <br>
       What ever happened to sweat?<br>

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins <br>
One for each of us and our sins <br>
So you lay us in a line <br>
Push your pins they make us humble <br>
Only you can tell in time <br>
If we fall or mearly stumble <br><br>

    But tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or fix this hole in mother's son? <br>
    Can you heal the broken worlds within? <br>
    Can you strip away so we may start again? <br><br>
  
    Tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or cut this rope and let us run? <br>
    Just when all seems fine <br>
    And I'm pain free <br>
    You jab another pin <br>
    Jab another pin in me <br><br>

Mirror, mirror upon the wall <br>
Break the spell or become the doll <br>
See you sharpening the pins <br>
So the holes will remind us <br>
We're just the toys in the hands of another <br>
And in time, the needles turn from shine to rust <br><br>

    But tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or fix this hole in mother's son? <br>
    Can you heal the broken worlds within? <br>
    Can you strip away so we may start again? <br><br>
  
    Tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or cut this rope and let us run? <br>
    Just when all seems fine <br>
    And I'm pain free <br>
    You jab another pin <br>
    Jab another pin in me <br><br>

    Jab it <br>
    Here come the pins <br><br>

Blood for face <br>
Sweat for dirt <br>
Three X's for the stone <br>
To break this curse <br>
A ritual's due <br>
I believe I'm not alone <br>
Shell of shotgun <br>
Pint of gin <br>
Numb us up to shield the pins <br>
Renew our faith <br>
Which way we can <br>
To fall in love with life again <br>
To fall in love with life again <br>
To fall in love with life again <br>
To fall in love <br>
To fall in love <br>
To fall in love with life again <br><br>

    So tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or fix this hole in mother's son? <br>
    Can you heal the broken worlds within? <br>
    Can you strip away so we may start again? <br><br>
  
    Tell me <br>
    Can you heal what father's done? <br>
    Or cut this rope and let us run? <br>
    Just when all seems fine <br>
    And I'm pain free <br>
    You jab another pin <br>
    Jab another pin in me <br><br>

    No more pins in me <br>
    No more, no more pins in me <br>
    No more, no more pins in me <br>
    No more, no more, no more <br>
    No, no, no<br>
