<font color="red">..::!Battery</font><br><br>
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction<br> 
Weak are ripped and torn away<br>
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower<br> 
Battery is here to stay<br><br>
chorus:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smashing through the boundaries<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lunacy has found me<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot stop the Battery<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounding out aggression<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turns into obsession<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot kill the Battery<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot kill the family<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battery is found in me<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battery<br><br>
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers<br> 
never ending potency<br> 
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker<br> 
Breeding on insanity<br><br>
Chorus<br><br>
Circle of Destruction, Hammer comes crushing<br> 
Powerhouse of energy<br> 
Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry<br> 
We create the Battery<br><br> 

Chorus<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Master of Puppets</font><br><br>
End of passion play, crumbling away<br> 
I'm your source of self-destruction<br> 
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear<br> 
Leading on your deaths construction<br><br> 

[Chorus:]<br> 
    Taste me you will see<br> 
    more is all you need<br> 
    you're dedicated to<br> 
    how I'm killing you<br><br> 

    Come crawling faster<br> 
    obey your Master<br> 
    your life burns faster<br> 
    obey your Master <br>
    Master <br><br>

        Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings<br> 
        twisting your mind and smashing your dreams <br>
        Blinded by me, you can't see a thing <br>
        Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream<br> 
        Master <br>
        Master <br>
        Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream<br> 
        Master <br>
        Master <br><br>

Needlework the way, never you betray<br> 
life of death becoming clearer <br>
Pain monopoly, ritual misery <br>
chop your breakfast on a mirror <br><br>

Chorus <br><br>

Master, Master, Where's the dreams that I've been after?<br> 
Master, Master, You promised only lies <br>
Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter<br> 
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries <br><br>

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat <br>
just a rhyme without a reason <br>
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days<br> 
now your life is out of season <br><br>

<font color="red">..::!Welcome Home</font><br><br>
Welcome to where time stands still <br>
no one leaves and no one will <br>
Moon is full, never seems to change <br>
just labeled mentally deranged <br>
Dream the same thing every night <br>
I see our freedom in my sight <br>
No locked doors, No windows barred <br>
No things to make my brain seem scarred <br><br>

Sleep my friend and you will see <br>
that dream is my reality <br>
They keep me locked up in this cage <br>
can't they see it's why my brain says Rage <br><br>

    Sanitarium, leave me be <br>
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone <br><br>

Build my fear of what's out there <br>
and cannot breathe the open air <br>
Whisper things into my brain <br>
assuring me that I'm insane <br>
They think our heads are in their hands <br>
but violent use brings violent plans <br>
Keep him tied, it makes him well <br>
he's getting better, can't you tell? <br><br>

No more can they keep us in <br>
Listen, damn it, we will win <br>
They see it right, they see it well <br>
but they think this saves us from our Hell <br><br>

    Sanitarium, leave me be <br>
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone <br>
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone <br><br>

Fear of living on <br>
natives getting restless now <br>
Mutiny in the air <br>
got some death to do <br>
Mirror stares back hard <br>
Kill, is such a friendly word <br>
seems the only way <br>
for reaching out again<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Disposable Heroes</font><br><br>
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end <br>
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend <br>
running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all <br>
Victim of what said should be <br>
a servant `til I fall <br><br>

Chorus: <br>
    Soldier boy, made of clay <br>
    now an empty shell <br>
    twenty one, only son <br>
    but he served us well <br>
    Bred to kill, not to care <br>
    just do as we say <br>
    finished here, Greeting Death <br>
    he's yours to take away <br><br>
        Back to the front <br>
        you will do what I say, when I say <br>
        Back to the front <br>
        you will die when I say, you must die <br>
        Back to the front <br>
        you coward <br>
        you servant <br>
        you blindman <br><br>
Barking of machine gun fire, does nothing to me now<br> 
sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow <br>
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends <br>
bodies fill the fields I see <br>
the slaughter never ends <br><br>
Chorus <br><br>
Why, Am I dying? <br>
Kill, have no fear <br>
Lie, live off lying <br>
Hell, Hell is here <br><br>

I was born for dying <br><br>

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say <br>
had no chance to see myself, molded day by day <br>
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done <br>
left to die with only friend <br>
Alone I clench my gun <br><br>

Chorus <br><br>

Back to the front.<br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Leper Messiah</font><br><br>
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part <br>
circus comes to town, you play the lead clown <br>
Please, please <br>
spreading his disease, living by his story <br>
Knees, knees <br>
falling to your knees, suffer for his glory <br>
You will <br><br>

[Chorus] <br>
   Time for lust, time for lie <br>
    time to kiss your life goodbye <br>
    Send me money, send me green <br>
    Heaven you will meet <br>
    Make a contribution <br>
    and you'll get a better seat <br><br>

Bow to Leper Messiah <br><br>

Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix <br>
blind devotion came, rotting your brain <br>
Chain, chain <br>
Join the endless chain <br>
Fame, Fame <br>
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power <br>
We see <br>

[Chorus] <br><br>

Bow to Leper Messiah <br><br>

Witchery, weakening <br>
Sees the sheep are gathering <br>
set the trap, hypnotize <br>
now you follow <br><br>

[Chorus] <br><br>

Lie. <br>
<hr size=0 noshade width="250"><br>
<font color="red">..::!Damage, Inc.</font><br><br>
Dealing out the agony within <br>
charging hard and no one's gonna give in <br>
Living on your knees, conformity <br>
or dying on your feet for honesty <br>
Inbred, our bodies work as one <br>
bloody, but never cry submission <br>
Following our instinct not a trend <br>
go against the grain until the end <br><br>

[Chorus:] <br>
    Blood will follow blood <br>
    Dying time is here <br>
    Damage Incorporated <br><br>

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback <br>
stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back <br>
Blood follows blood and we make sure <br>
life ain't for you and we're the cure <br>
Honesty is my only excuse <br>
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use <br>
Steamroller action crushing all <br>
Victim is your name and you shall fall <br><br>

[Chorus] <br><br>

We chew and spit you out <br>
we laugh, you scream and shout <br>
All flee, with fear you run <br>
You'll know just where we come from <br><br>

Damage Incorporated <br><br>

Damage jackals ripping right through you <br>
sight and smell of this, it gets me goin' <br>
Know just how to get just what we want <br>
tear it from your soul in nightly hunt <br>
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets <br>
Never happy ending on these dark sets <br>
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see <br>
step a little closer if you please <br>

[Chorus]
