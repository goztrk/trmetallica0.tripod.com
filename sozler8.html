Love that little lady always on my mind<br>
She gives me loving every night and day<br>
Never gonna leave her, never going away<br><br>

Someone to love me<br>
You know she makes me feel all right, yeah (all right)<br>
Someone to need me<br>
Love me every single night, yeah<br><br>

Feel so happy since I met that girl<br>
When we're making love<br>
It's something out of this world<br>
Feels so good to know that she's all mine<br>
Gonna love that woman 'til the end of time<br><br>

Someone to live for<br>
Love me 'til the end of time, hey, hey-yeah<br>
She makes me feel happy<br>
It's good to know that she's all mine<br><br>

I am the world that hides<br>
The universal secret of all time<br>
Destruction of the empty spaces<br>
Is my one and only crime<br>
I've lived a thousand times<br>
I found out what it means to be believed<br>
The thoughts and images<br>
The unborn child that never was conceived<br><br>

You gotta believe me<br>
Hey, I'm talking to you<br><br>

Well, I know, it's hard for you<br>
To know the reason why<br>
And I know you'll understand<br>
More when it's time to die<br>
Don't believe the life you have<br>
Will be the only one<br>
You have to let your body sleep<br>
To let your soul live on, haha<br><br>

Ooh<br>
Feel so happy since I met that girl<br>

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha<br>
You can listen to the engines moaning out as one note song<br>
You think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before<br><br>

But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do<br>
When you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do<br>
And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through<br><br>

Here I am - on the road again<br>
There I am - up on the stage<br>
Here I go - playing star again<br>
There I go - turn the page<br><br>

So you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road<br>
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold<br>
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode<br><br>

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can<br>
Oh, the same old clichés, "Is it woman? Is it man?"<br>
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand<br>
Make your stand<br><br>

Here I am - on the road again<br>
There I am - up on the stage<br>
Here I go - playing star again<br>
There I go - turn the page<br><br>

Oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away<br>
Every ounce of energy you try to give away<br>
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play, yeah<br>

Later in the evening, you lie awake in bed<br>
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head<br>
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said<br>
What she said<br><br>

He-ey<br><br>

Yeah<br>
Here I am - on the road again<br>
There I am - up on the stage<br>
Here I go - playing star again<br>
There I go - turn the page<br>
