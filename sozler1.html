No life till leather <br>
We are gonna kick some ass tonight <br>
We got the metal madness <br>
When our fans start screaming <br>
It's right well alright <br>
When we start to rock <br>
We never want to stop again <br><br>

    Hit the lights <br>
    Hit the lights <br>
    Hit the lights <br><br>

You know our fans are insane <br>
We are gonna blow this place away <br>
with volume higher <br>
Than anything today the only way <br>
When we start to rock <br>
We never want to stop again <br><br>

    Hit the lights <br>
    Hit the lights <br>
    Hit the lights <br>

With all our screaming <br>
We are gonna rip right through your brain <br>

<font color="red">..::!The Four Horsemen</font><br><br>
By the last breath of the fourth winds blow <br>
Better raise your ears <br>
The sound of hooves knocks at your door <br>
Lock up your wife and children now <br>
It's time to wield the blade <br>
For now you have got some company <br><br>

    The Horsemen are drawing nearer <br>
    On the leather steeds they ride <br>
    They have come to take your life <br>
    On through the dead of night <br>
    With the four Horsemen ride <br>
    or choose your fate and die <br><br>

You have been dying since the day <br>
You were born <br>
You know it has all been planned <br>
The quartet of deliverance rides <br>
A sinner once a sinner twice <br>
No need for confession now <br>
Cause now you have got the fight of your life <br>

    The Horsemen are drawing nearer <br>
    On the leather steeds they ride <br>
    They have come to take your life <br>
    On through the dead of night <br>
    With the four Horsemen ride <br>
    or choose your fate and die <br><br>

Time <br>
has taken its toll on you <br>
The lines that crack your face <br>
Famine <br>
Your body it has torn through <br>
Withered in every place <br>
Pestilence <br>
For what you have had to endure <br>
And what you have put others through <br>
Death <br>
Deliverance for you for sure <br>
There is nothing you can do <br><br>

So gather round young warriors now <br>
and saddle up your steeds <br>
Killing scores with demon swords <br>
Now is the death of doers of wrong <br>
Swing the judgment hammer down <br>
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat <br><br>

    The Horsemen are drawing nearer <br>
    On the leather steeds they ride <br>
    They have come to take your life <br>

Living and dying laughing and crying <br>
Once you have seen it you will never be the same <br>
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems <br>
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean <br><br>

    Motorbreath <br>
    Its how I live my life <br>
    I can't take it any other way <br>
    Motorbreath <br>
    The sign of living fast <br>
    It is going to take <br>
    Your breath away <br><br>

Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing <br>
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way <br>
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line <br>
Sending the shivers up and down your spine <br><br>

    Motorbreath <br>
    Its how I live my life <br>
    I can't take it any other way <br>
    Motorbreath <br>
    The sign of living fast <br>
    It is going to take <br>
    Your breath away <br><br>

Those people who tell you not to take chances <br>
They are all missing on what life is about <br>
You only live once so take hold of the chance <br>
Don't end up like others the same song and dance <br><br>

    Motorbreath <br>
    Its how I live my life <br>
    I can't take it any other way <br>
    Motorbreath <br>
    The sign of living fast <br>

Down in the depths of my fiery home <br>
The summons bell will chime <br>
Tempting you and all the earth <br>
to join our sinful kind <br>

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins <br>
The end is closing in <br>
Feeding on the minds of man <br>
and from their souls within <br>
My disciples all shout to search out <br>
And they always shall obey <br>
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild <br>
But do just as I say <br><br>

    So come on <br>
    Jump in the Fire <br>
    So come on <br>
    Jump in the Fire <br><br>

Jump by your will or be taken by force <br>

Trying to keep the hellfire lit <br>
I am stalking you as prey <br>
Living your life as me I am you you see <br>
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land <br>
Come home where you belong <br><br>
